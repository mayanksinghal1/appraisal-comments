I have few points to raise regarding my resignation to be concerned:

1. Since beginning in xyz , I never got the opportunity to work as per my skill set & not allocated to any client project yet. Even I raised this concern with management but my concerned doesn't got resolved.

2. Compensation is another concern which I want to raise here. As per market correction, I am not fully satisfy with my current compensation. 

If my concerns get resolve then I will definitely want to stay in xyz as it has an employee friendly policy structure & provides good work-life balance.
